# MarioBox

MarioBox is a NES Emulator for macOS based on OpenGL.

This is a personal project, with no intention to be a perfect emulation tool! This is just a passionate tribute to a piece of technology that has a special place in my memories and my heart... and an amazing project to test low-level C++ programming!
